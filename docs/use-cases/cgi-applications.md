Ferron supports classic CGI applications through the `cgi` module. This is mainly useful for legacy stacks and script-based workflows.

For new deployments, prefer HTTP reverse proxying or FastCGI when possible, because it avoids starting a new process per request and usually performs better.

## Basic CGI setup

To run CGI programs, enable `cgi`:

```kdl
// Example configuration with CGI enabled. Replace "example.com" with your domain name.
example.com {
    root "/var/www/html" // Replace with your site directory
    cgi
}
```

In this setup, scripts inside `cgi-bin` can be executed as CGI programs.

## Executing scripts by extension

You can also execute CGI scripts outside `cgi-bin` using `cgi_extension`:

```kdl
// Example configuration with CGI extensions. Replace "example.com" with your domain name.
example.com {
    root "/var/www/html" // Replace with your site directory
    cgi
    cgi_extension ".cgi" ".pl" ".py"
}
```

## Custom CGI interpreters and environment variables

If needed, define explicit interpreters and pass environment variables to CGI applications:

```kdl
// Example configuration with CGI interpreters and environment variables.
example.com {
    root "/var/www/html" // Replace with your site directory
    cgi
    cgi_extension ".cgi" ".pl" ".py"
    cgi_interpreter ".py" "/usr/bin/python3"
    cgi_interpreter ".pl" "/usr/bin/perl"
    cgi_environment "PATH" "/usr/bin:/bin"
}
```

## FastCGI with fcgiwrap

Alternatively, you can use [fcgiwrap](https://github.com/gnosek/fcgiwrap) to run CGI applications over the FastCGI protocol. This allows you to serve CGI scripts using the FastCGI module, which can be useful for unifying backend configurations or integrating with existing FastCGI setups.

To use fcgiwrap, ensure it is installed and running, then configure your site as follows:

```kdl
// Example configuration for fcgiwrap.
example.com {
    root "/var/www/html"

    // Specify extensions to handle via FastCGI
    fcgi_extension ".cgi" ".sh"

    // Connect to the fcgiwrap socket (adjust path for your system)
    // On Debian/Ubuntu, this is often unix:///var/run/fcgiwrap.socket
    fcgi "unix:///run/fcgiwrap.socket"

    // Optional: Set environment variables if required by your scripts
    fcgi_environment "MY_APP_MODE" "production"
}
```

## Notes and troubleshooting

- If a script is downloaded instead of executed, verify `cgi` is enabled and the script extension is listed in `cgi_extension` (when outside `cgi-bin`).
- If CGI scripts fail with `500 Internal Server Error`, confirm executable permissions and interpreter paths.
- If using PHP via CGI, you may need `cgi.force_redirect = 0` in the CGI `php.ini`, depending on your PHP-CGI build.
- Keep upload/download directories outside `cgi-bin` to reduce the risk of accidental execution of uploaded files.
- For PHP-specific guidance, see [PHP hosting](/docs/use-cases/php).
- For directive reference (`cgi`, `cgi_extension`, `cgi_interpreter`, `cgi_environment`), see [Configuration: application backends](/docs/configuration/application-backends).
