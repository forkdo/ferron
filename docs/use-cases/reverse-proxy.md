title: Reverse proxying
---

Configuring Ferron as a reverse proxy is straightforward - you just need to specify the backend server URL in `proxy` directive. To configure Ferron as a reverse proxy, you can use the configuration below:

```kdl
// Example configuration with reverse proxy. Replace "example.com" with your domain name.
example.com {
    proxy "http://localhost:3000/" // Replace "http://localhost:3000" with the backend server URL
}
```

## Reverse proxy with static file serving support

Ferron supports serving static files and reverse proxying at once. You can use this configuration for this use case:

```kdl
// Example configuration with reverse proxy and static file serving. Replace "example.com" with your domain name.
example.com {
    // The "/api" location is used for reverse proxying
    // For example, the "/api/login" endpoint is proxied to "http://localhost:3000/api/login"
    location "/api" remove_base=#true {
        proxy "http://localhost:3000/api" // Replace "http://localhost:3000/api" with the backend API URL
    }

    // The "/" location is used for serving static files
    location "/" {
        root "/var/www/html" // Replace "/var/www/html" with the directory containing your static files
    }
}
```

## Reverse proxy with a single-page application

Ferron supports serving a single-page application and reverse proxying at once. You can use this configuration for this use case:

```kdl
// Example configuration with reverse proxy and static file serving. Replace "example.com" with your domain name.
example.com {
    // The "/api" location is used for reverse proxying
    // For example, the "/api/login" endpoint is proxied to "http://localhost:3000/api/login"
    location "/api" remove_base=#true {
        proxy "http://localhost:3000/api" // Replace "http://localhost:3000/api" with the backend API URL
    }

    // The "/" location is used for serving static files
    location "/" {
        root "/var/www/html" // Replace "/var/www/html" with the directory containing your static files
        rewrite "^/.*" "/" directory=#false file=#false last=#true
    }
}
```

## Load balancing

Ferron supports load balancing by specifying multiple backend servers in the `proxy` directive. To configure Ferron as a load balancer, you can use the configuration below:

```kdl
// Example configuration with load balancing. Replace "example.com" with your domain name.
example.com {
    proxy "http://localhost:3000/" // Replace "http://localhost:3000" with the backend server URL
    proxy "http://localhost:3001/" // Replace "http://localhost:3001" with the second backend server URL
}
```

## Health checks

Ferron supports passive health checks; you can enable it using `lb_health_check` directive. To configure Ferron as a load balancer with passive health checking, you can use the configuration below:

```kdl
// Example configuration with load balancing and passive health checking. Replace "example.com" with your domain name.
example.com {
    proxy "http://localhost:3000/" // Replace "http://localhost:3000" with the backend server URL
    proxy "http://localhost:3001/" // Replace "http://localhost:3001" with the second backend server URL
    lb_health_check
}
```

## Caching reverse proxy

Ferron supports in-memory caching for speeding up websites. To enable in-memory caching for the reverse proxy, you can use this configuration:

```kdl
// Example configuration with caching reverse proxy. Replace "example.com" with your domain name.
example.com {
    proxy "http://localhost:3000/" // Replace "http://localhost:3000" with the backend server URL
    cache
    // Optional: set Cache-Control header if you want to also cache responses from backend servers without the Cache-Control header
    header "Cache-Control" "max-age=3600"
}
```

## Reverse proxying with intact "Host" header

Ferron by default rewrites the "Host" header before sending the request to the backend server, and preserves the original "Host" header value in the "X-Forwarded-Host" header.

However, there are web applications that may not work with this configuration. This can result in host header mismatch errors, and other issues.

In such cases, you can set the "Host" header value to the original value:

```kdl
// Example configuration with reverse proxy and intact "Host" header. Replace "example.com" with your domain name.
example.com {
    proxy "http://localhost:3000/" // Replace "http://localhost:3000" with the backend server URL
    proxy_request_header_replace "Host" "{header:Host}"
}
```

## Reverse proxy to backends listening on Unix sockets

Ferron supports reverse proxying to backends listening on Unix sockets. To configure Ferron for reverse proxying to backends listening on Unix sockets, you can use this configuration:

```kdl
// Example configuration with reverse proxy to backends listening on Unix sockets. Replace "example.com" with your domain name.
example.com {
    proxy "http://example.com" unix="/run/backend/web.sock" // The "example.com" in the backend URL can be replaced with an arbitrary domain name
}
```

## Reverse proxy to gRPC backends

Ferron supports reverse proxying to gRPC backends that accept HTTP/2 requests either via HTTPS, or plaintext with prior knowledge. To configure Ferron for reverse proxying to gRPC backends, you can use this configuration:

```kdl
// Example configuration with reverse proxy to gRPC backends. Replace "grpc.example.com" with your domain name.
grpc.example.com {
    proxy "http://localhost:3000/" // Replace "http://localhost:3000" with the backend server URL
    proxy_http2_only // Enables HTTP/2-only proxying to support gRPC proxying
}
```

## Example: Ferron multiplexing to several backend servers

In this example, the `example.com` and `bar.example.com` domains point to a server running Ferron.

Below are assumptions made for this example:

- `https://example.com` is "main site", while `https://example.com/agenda` is hosting a calendar service.
- `https://foo.example.com` is passed to `https://saas.foo.net`
- `https://bar.example.com` is the front for an internal backend.

You can configure Ferron like this:

```kdl
* {
    tls "/path/to/certificate.crt" "/path/to/private.key"
}

example.com {
    location "/agenda" {
        // It proxies /agenda/example to http://calender.example.net:5000/agenda/example
        proxy "http://calender.example.net:5000"
    }

    location "/" {
        // Catch-all path
        proxy "http://localhost:3000/"
    }
}

foo.example.com {
    proxy "https://saas.foo.net"
}

bar.example.com {
    proxy "http://backend.example.net:4000"
}
```

For `http://calender.example.net:5000/agenda/example`, you will probably have to either configure the calendar service to strip 'agenda/' or configure URL rewriting in Ferron.
